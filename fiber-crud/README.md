# ðŸ“š Fiber CRUD API using Go

We use books (no database here). Just getting familiar with the syntax for making Go APIs.

### Get Started

1. `go build`
2. `go run fiber-crud.exe`

### API Docs

1. Make sure you have the ThunderClient installed for VSCode
2. `thunderclient.json` contains all the APIs for this project.
